# Copy Link and Text Firefox Extension

Adds a context menu item called `Copy Link and Text`, which copies a link's URL and text to the clipboard as rich text and Markdown links.

Multiple links in selected text will be copied as a list of links. If the selected text contains no links, the extension creates [text fragments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Fragment/Text_fragments) from selected text ranges.

For browser tabs, the link consists of the tab's URL and title.

Links can also be copied via the [configurable shortcut](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox) `Alt+X`.
