# Copy Link and Text Firefox Extension

Copy links and their text to the clipboard, paste as HTML or Markdown.

Adds a context menu item called `Copy Link and Text`, which will copy the link URL and link text to the clipboard, so that they are pasted as rich text HTML links if supported, as Markdown links otherwise.
