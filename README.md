# Copy Link and Text Firefox Extension

Adds a context menu item called `Copy Link and Text`, which copies the link URL and link text to the clipboard, so that they are pasted as rich text HTML links if supported, as Markdown links otherwise.

For browser tabs, the link consists of the tab's URL and title.
